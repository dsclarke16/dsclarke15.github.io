    <h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
    <p>
      This website was built by Daniel Clarke while compleating CSCI434: Web Programming at Southwestern College.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of completing this course, I will build his website along these projected objectives. 
    </p> 
    <p> 
      Unit 2: I will add 2 paragraphs describing myself, 3 links to websites that are related to my hobbies, <br>
      at least two pictures relating to myself or my hobbies, and plans for future additions to my website.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I chose github to host my repository mostly due to an element of peer pressure. In my time as a student <br>
      and in my private time researching programming, github is the site I have seen the most frequently.
