    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p class="normal">
      This website was built by Daniel Clarke while compleating CSCI434: Web Programming at Southwestern College.
    </p>
    <p class="normal">
      In the course of completing this course, I will build this website along these projected objectives. 
    </p> 
    <p class="normal"> 
      Week 2 Objectives: <br>
       I will add 2 paragraphs describing myself, 3 links to websites that are related to my hobbies, 
      at least two pictures relating to myself or my hobbies, and plans for future additions to my website.
    </p>
    <p class="normal">
      I chose github to host my repository mostly due to an element of peer pressure. In my time as a student 
      and in my private time researching programming, github is the site I have seen the most frequently. 
    </p>
    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p class="normal">
        I am Daniel Clarke. I am a Staff Sergeant in the US Air Force. My job is to maintain the various pieces of equipment 
        that is used for air traffic control. Those are things like radar, radios, and navigation aids. In my shop we have a 
        slogan that is a play on the YOLO acronym: Without us, <em>you only land once</em>. 
    </p>
    <p class="normal">
        That is me in my work time. In my off time, I do a lot of nerdy things. I have several dozen games that can take as 
        long as 9 hours to complete or even weeks for campaign games. I am also somewhat of a chef. Not anywhere near a 
        professional level, but I do all right. I recently aquired a smoker so I have been playing around with that. 
        I have a labrador/australian shepherd who is a big old goober for those he loves, but a fierce guardian to 
        those he does not know.

        Week 3 Objectives: <br>
        I will be creating a design document that will outling a multimedia page for this website that  teaches 
        a simple skill or process. This skill or process will be related to a hobby or interest of mine. I will 
        modify my page further based on that living document.
    </p>

  <h2>Week 4</h2>

  <p>
    Week 5 Objectives: <br>
    During week 5 of my course I will use the design document to add 3 more pages to my website. These will include 
    an image gallery, a links page, and a page displaying my design document.
